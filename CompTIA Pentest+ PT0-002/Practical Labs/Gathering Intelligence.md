### Gathering Intelligence
- You can use the nslookup and dig command to grab information related to DNS records.
- The ping and host command to check if the domain is up.

dig @203.0.113.225 www.structureality.com
Interactive nslookup
$ nslookup
> set type=soa
> example.com

This will look up the start of authority from a domain. This is very useful for web testing as it tells you the
refresh, origin, mail and expiry of the domain. The mail addr is the mail without the @
hostmaster@structureality.com
Likewise for mx "set type=mx". ns, mx, soa.

Also have the whois command which is useful to find out when the domain was registered, the owner,
and other registrant details.
$ whois domain.com

Basic OSINT
Find company social media profiles, scrape their website for contact details such as emails, phone
numbers. This can also help find out the structure of a company and help with social engineering, and
craft phishing attacks for red teamers.
